## Hi, I'm Troy! 👋

I'm a junior studying Physics (BSc Hons) at Michigan State University, with a minor in Computational Math, Science, and Engineering. My academic and professional experiences blend a strong foundation in physics with data science and software engineering. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex problems in both scientific research and real-world applications.


🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently seeking a project at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) that combines physics, computer science, and data analysis. These subjects are deeply important to me because they provide powerful tools to understand and explore the physical world through data-driven approaches. My goal is to apply my knowledge from both my Physics major and Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE) minor to solve complex problems, while also learning advanced computer science techniques that extend beyond my coursework. By working on a project like this, I aim to further develop my skills and contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge research..


💼 Internship Goals

I am actively seeking internships in data science, sports analytics, and quantitative analysis, with a focus on companies in financial services, sports organizations, and high-tech industries. 


🏆 Skills

Proficient in Python: Extensive experience in data analysis, numerical modeling, and scientific computing.

Familiar with Java and JavaScript: Completed coursework in both, but still gaining hands-on experience.

Exploring SQL and R: Currently self-learning these tools to expand my data analysis and modeling capabilities.
