## Hi, I'm Troy! 👋

I'm a senior studying Physics (BSc Hons) at Michigan State University, with a minor in Computational Math, Science, and Engineering. My academic and professional experiences blend a strong foundation in physics with data science and software engineering. I am passionate about using computational skills to study physics.


🌱 Current Focus

I am currently working as a Student Research Assistant at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). 

•I lead a computational nuclear astrophysics project studying the competition between beta decay and electron capture in stellar environments and their impact on core-collapse supernovae. I extended the [NuLib](https://github.com/evanoconnor/NuLib) neutrino interaction library in Fortran to calculate antineutrino spectra, then integrated these results into [GR1D](https://github.com/evanoconnor/GR1D) simulations to analyze their effects on supernova dynamics. All calculations and simulations were parallelized with MPI/OpenMP and run in HPC environments using bash workflows and SLURM scripts, with Python tools developed for post-processing and data visualization. The manuscript is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21567)!

•I contribute to [Bayesian Mass Explorer](https://github.com/massexplorer) [(bmex.dev)](bmex.dev/masses), a web tool for exploring nuclear properties and theoretical models. This project involves developing web applications, coding in Python for scientific computing, and performing data analysis to evaluate theoretical predictions. 

•I co-developed [pyBMC](https://github.com/ascsn/pybmc), an open-source Python package for Bayesian model combination. This generalizable Bayesian machine-learning framework integrates calculations from multiple models to create combined informed predictions with quantified uncertainties. A large motivation behind this project was to create a usable package based off of a [theoretical method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10839), that can be used in any field that requires various models, not just nuclear physics.



🏔️ Hobbies

In my free time, you’ll catch me lifting weights, exploring the outdoors, or watching sports. I am super passionate about leading a healthy lifestyle, so I am always excited to get outside and get moving. In the summer, I love mountain biking, kayaking, fishing, running, hiking, wakesurfing, and wakeboarding, along with wild camping and backpacking year-round (the snow adds a challenge). In the winter, I love to ski and hope to try mountaineering soon. I also practice jiu-jitsu and enjoy diving into sports analytics in my downtime. I’m passionate about staying active, connecting with nature, and discovering new adventures. It is important to me to live every day to the fullest and always seek out adventure. My love for adventure shines through my experiences, including a 5.5-month study abroad based in Norway that ended with 1.5 months of solo travel through Central and Eastern Europe. I’m always eager to explore new places, meet new people, try new activities, and embrace the unexpected.
