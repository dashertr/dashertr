## Hi, I'm Troy! 👋

I'm a junior studying Physics (BSc Hons) at Michigan State University, with a minor in Computational Math, Science, and Engineering. My academic and professional experiences blend a strong foundation in physics with data science and software engineering. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex problems in both scientific research and real-world applications.


🌱 Current Focus

I am currently working as a Student Research Assistant at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), contributing to BMEX.dev—a cloud-enabled web tool for exploring nuclear properties and theoretical models. This project involves developing web applications, coding in Python for scientific computing, and performing data analysis to evaluate theoretical predictions. Through this work, I’m honing skills in frontend development, cloud-based tools, and data-driven research. My ultimate goal is to combine physics, computer science, and data analysis to create innovative solutions for complex research challenges, while gaining advanced technical experience that extends beyond my coursework.


🏆 Skills

Proficient in Python: Extensive experience in data analysis, numerical modeling, and scientific computing.

Familiar with Java and JavaScript: Completed coursework in both, but still gaining hands-on experience.

Exploring SQL and R: Currently self-learning these tools to expand my data analysis and modeling capabilities.

🏔️ Hobbies

In my free time, you’ll catch me lifting weights, exploring the outdoors, or watching sports. I am super passionate about leading a healthy lifestyle so I am always excited to get outside and get moving. In the summer, I love mountain biking, kayaking, fishing, running, hiking, wakesurfing, and wakeboarding, along with wild camping and backpacking year-round (the snow adds a challenge). In the winter, I love to ski and hope to try mountaineering soon. I also practice jiu-jitsu and enjoy diving into advanced sports analytics in my downtime. I’m passionate about staying active, connecting with nature, and discovering new adventures. It is important to me to live every day to the fullest and always seek out adventure. My love for adventure shines through my experiences, including a 5.5-month study abroad based in Norway that ended with 1.5 months of solo travel through Central and Eastern Europe. I’m always eager to explore new places, meet new people, try new activities, and embrace the unexpected.
