## Hi, I'm Troy! üëã

I'm a senior studying Physics (BSc Hons) at Michigan State University, with a minor in Computational Math, Science, and Engineering. My academic and professional experiences blend a strong foundation in physics with data science and software engineering. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex problems in both scientific research and real-world applications.


üå± Current Focus

I am currently working as a Student Research Assistant at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). 

‚Ä¢I lead a computational nuclear astrophysics project studying the competition between beta decay and electron capture in stellar environments and their impact on core-collapse supernovae. I extended the NuLib neutrino interaction library in Fortran to calculate antineutrino spectra, then integrated these results into GR1D simulations to analyze their effects on supernova dynamics. All calculations and simulations were parallelized with MPI/OpenMP and run in HPC environments using batch workflows and SLURM scripts, with Python tools developed for post-processing and data visualization.

‚Ä¢I contribute to BMEX.dev, a cloud-enabled web tool for exploring nuclear properties and theoretical models. This project involves developing web applications, coding in Python for scientific computing, and performing data analysis to evaluate theoretical predictions. Through this work, I‚Äôm honing skills in frontend development, cloud-based tools, and data-driven research. My ultimate goal is to combine physics, computer science, and data analysis to create innovative solutions for complex research challenges, while gaining advanced technical experience that extends beyond my coursework.

‚Ä¢I co-developed pyBMC, an open-source Python package for Bayesian model combination, designed to optimally merge predictions from multiple models with principled uncertainty quantification and optional model orthogonalization. This project involves implementing statistical inference methods, building object-oriented scientific software, and creating flexible data-handling utilities for diverse research domains. Through this work, I‚Äôm advancing my skills in scientific programming, statistical modeling, and reproducible research practices. My ultimate goal is to leverage physics, computational methods, and data science to develop robust, generalizable tools that support high-impact research across disciplines.



üèîÔ∏è Hobbies

In my free time, you‚Äôll catch me lifting weights, exploring the outdoors, or watching sports. I am super passionate about leading a healthy lifestyle, so I am always excited to get outside and get moving. In the summer, I love mountain biking, kayaking, fishing, running, hiking, wakesurfing, and wakeboarding, along with wild camping and backpacking year-round (the snow adds a challenge). In the winter, I love to ski and hope to try mountaineering soon. I also practice jiu-jitsu and enjoy diving into advanced sports analytics in my downtime. I‚Äôm passionate about staying active, connecting with nature, and discovering new adventures. It is important to me to live every day to the fullest and always seek out adventure. My love for adventure shines through my experiences, including a 5.5-month study abroad based in Norway that ended with 1.5 months of solo travel through Central and Eastern Europe. I‚Äôm always eager to explore new places, meet new people, try new activities, and embrace the unexpected.
