## Hi, I'm Troy! 👋

I'm a junior studying Physics (BSc Hons) at Michigan State University, with a minor in Computational Math, Science, and Engineering. My academic and professional experiences blend a strong foundation in physics with data science and software engineering. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex problems in both scientific research and real-world applications.


🌱 Current Project

Doing research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, Working with a team on the development of bmex.dev, a platform designed to advance the analysis of beam monitoring and experimental data at FRIB This involves implementing data analysis algorithms, optimizing computational models, and building tools for visualizing experimental results. My work contributes to a deeper understanding of rare isotopes and their behavior.


💼 Internship Goals

I am actively seeking internships in data science, sports analytics, and quantitative analysis, with a focus on companies in financial services, sports organizations, and high-tech industries. 


🏆 Skills

Proficient in Python: Extensive experience in data analysis, numerical modeling, and scientific computing.

Familiar with Java and JavaScript: Completed coursework in both, but still gaining hands-on experience.

Exploring SQL and R: Currently self-learning these tools to expand my data analysis and modeling capabilities.
